# üöÄ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

## ‚úÖ Pre-deployment Preparation Completed
- [x] Build compilation errors fixed
- [x] MongoDB Atlas connection configured
- [x] CORS configured for production
- [x] Kubernetes health checks added
- [x] Environment template created

## üîß Manual Steps Required Before Deployment

### 1. MongoDB Atlas Setup
- [ ] Create MongoDB Atlas cluster
- [ ] Create database user with read/write permissions
- [ ] Whitelist Emergent deployment IP ranges
- [ ] Copy connection string
- [ ] Update MONGO_URL environment variable

### 2. Environment Variables Configuration  
- [ ] Set REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL to your deployment URL
- [ ] Set MONGO_URL to Atlas connection string
- [ ] Set EMERGENT_LLM_KEY for AI features
- [ ] Verify all required environment variables

### 3. Deployment Configuration
- [ ] Verify package.json dependencies
- [ ] Confirm requirements.txt is updated
- [ ] Test build locally: `npm run build`
- [ ] Verify backend starts: `python server.py`

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Check /health endpoint responds
- [ ] Check /ready endpoint responds  
- [ ] Verify login functionality
- [ ] Test database connectivity
- [ ] Verify AI features work

## üåê Production URLs to Test
- Health Check: https://your-app.emergentagent.com/health
- Readiness: https://your-app.emergentagent.com/ready
- Main App: https://your-app.emergentagent.com
- API Base: https://your-app.emergentagent.com/api

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### MongoDB Atlas Connection
- Ensure IP whitelist includes deployment IPs
- Verify username/password in connection string
- Check database name matches in URL

### Environment Variables
- REACT_APP_* variables must be set at build time
- Backend variables must be available at runtime
- Case-sensitive variable names

### CORS Issues
- Update allow_origins to specific domain in production
- Verify REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL matches deployment URL
