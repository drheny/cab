# Test Results and Communication Log

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing Guidelines
- MUST test backend first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Test each feature individually before moving to next
- Always validate API responses and data structure
- Check error handling and edge cases

### Frontend Testing Guidelines  
- ONLY test frontend after user permission
- Use `ask_human` tool before frontend testing
- Test UI functionality and user interactions
- Validate responsive design

### Communication Protocol
- Document each test phase and results
- Note any issues found and fixes applied
- Track progress feature by feature
- Report summary after each testing phase
