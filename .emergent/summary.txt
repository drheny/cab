The previous AI engineer successfully launched the medical cabinet management system from MVP, incorporating AI data enrichment, WhatsApp integration, and a full authentication system. The current AI engineer then enhanced bidirectional messaging, customizable UI names, and numerous UI/UX elements, including internal messaging styling and patient search. Key recent work involved overhauling the consultation modal to support TN currency, simplified diagnostic/observation fields, and a new vaccine reminder system with WhatsApp integration, along with fixing its dashboard button.

Subsequently, the engineer addressed several user-reported issues and feature requests: rectifying duplicate internal messaging notifications by implementing a robust WebSocket singleton, achieving an ultra-minimalist messaging bubble design with single emojis, and successfully integrating advanced AI/ML predictions using Google Gemini into the Administration page, removing the redundant AI Room. Finally, the patient list layout was optimized by integrating the WhatsApp icon into the Actions column, and real-time message read receipts, sound notifications, and emoji alignment were fixed. The current focus, as the trajectory concludes, is on optimizing the Consultation page for quick consultation creation.

<pending_tasks>
- No pending implementation tasks from the previous engineering cycle.
- The AI's proposed enhancements for the Actions rapides section on the Dashboard (Chat Message 363) and further optimizations for the Facturation page (Chat Message 195) were discussed but not explicitly chosen for immediate implementation by the user.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in optimizing the Consultation page based on a user request. The user wants to enhance the Ajouter consultation button's functionality. Currently, this button is disabled and only activates after a patient is selected. The desired new behavior is for the button to open a modal that allows for quick consultation addition for either an existing or a new patient.

This new modal should facilitate:
- Loading an existing patient's name or providing an option to check new patient (similar to the add appointment modal).
- Input fields for Mon Jul 28 20:32:34 UTC 2025,  (visit) or  (check-up).
- Payment details:  (payment amount),  (insured or not).

These collected data points are intended to either create a new patient record or link the consultation to an existing one, and capture the consultation type and payment information. After filling these details, clicking a commencer consultation (start consultation) button in this quick modal should then navigate the user to the main consultation modal (the one typically loaded from the calendar) to complete the full consultation details.

The AI engineer has begun the analysis of the  file to understand its current state and implement this new workflow.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the quick consultation creation modal by modifying the Ajouter consultation button's behavior on the Consultation page.
