The previous AI engineer successfully launched the application from scratch, building core functionalities. Subsequently, the focus shifted to enhancing existing features and introducing new, complex systems. The initial task was to resolve multi-instance modal issues in  and develop advanced reporting in  with ML predictions. This also included user management refinements. The immediate preceding work involved a detailed discussion and implementation of an AI-powered waiting room system, initially as a separate AI Room page, later refined into an AI-assisted WhatsApp communication hub integrated directly into the  page. This WhatsApp Hub, allowing secretary-controlled messaging with AI suggestions, has been fully implemented, tested, and debugged, including dynamic message editing. The current focus is on building the data enrichment foundation for advanced AI predictions (temporal, proactive, and behavioral patterns).

<product_requirements>
The application is a medical cabinet management system covering patients, consultations, and finances with real-time messaging. Initially, the system needed fixes for the Impay√© filter, a comprehensive Administration page (user management, access rights, patient stats, monthly reports, data backup/export), and UI/UX improvements (dashboard notifications, quick actions, message deletion, iPad stylus optimization). A critical fix involved supporting multiple independent consultation modal instances in . The latest major feature involved developing an AI-powered waiting room system, which evolved into a secretary-controlled WhatsApp communication hub. This hub provides automatic appointment confirmations, real-time waiting room updates (rank, estimated time), and flexible delayed appointment notifications via WhatsApp links, all enhanced by AI predictions and requiring secretary confirmation for sending. Future work focuses on enriching AI data, temporal predictions, and proactive suggestions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was deep into enhancing the AI capabilities for the medical cabinet application, specifically focusing on data enrichment and advanced prediction models for the WhatsApp Hub and overall system optimization.

The work involves:
1.  **Establishing a Data Enrichment Engine**: This is a backend system designed to automatically collect and process various types of data crucial for robust AI predictions. This includes:
    *   **Temporal Data**: Collecting patterns related to time (hourly, daily, seasonal efficiencies).
    *   **Doctor Performance Data**: Analyzing doctor's consultation patterns and efficiency over time.
    *   **Patient Behavior Data**: Tracking patient punctuality, communication responsiveness, and other behavioral traits.
    *   **External Factors Data**: Incorporating external data like weather, traffic, and school schedules to influence predictions.
2.  **Defining Backend Architecture for AI**: New Pydantic models (, , ) are being introduced to structure the enriched data. Corresponding FastAPI endpoints (, etc.) are being created to allow the system to receive and store this data.
3.  **Developing Core AI Engines**: The engineer is in the process of defining classes like , , , , , and . These classes will contain the logic for data collection, processing, and generating advanced AI insights.

The trajectory ends mid-development of the , indicating that the foundation for collecting and enriching data, along with defining the classes for temporal predictions and proactive suggestions, is currently being built in . This foundational work is critical for the next phases of advanced AI features.
