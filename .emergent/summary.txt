The AI engineer's trajectory shows an initial focus on enhancing financial and dashboard features in a medical cabinet management system, including advanced statistics and reminders. A critical, unresolved issue was the inconsistent display of payment amounts in the consultation modal. However, the user then pivoted, requesting a complete real-time instant messaging system. The AI engineer successfully implemented this new feature, iteratively resolving issues like real-time message display, message duplication, delete functionality (which proved persistent and required a custom confirmation modal), read receipts, visual design refinements, sender name abbreviations, and sound notifications. Backend WebSocket routing was corrected for Kubernetes ingress. The previously identified payment display issue was left unaddressed due to this task shift.

<product_requirements>
The application is a full-stack medical cabinet management system. Initial requirements included stabilizing backend/frontend, managing patient consultations (weight, height, observations, stopwatch), and redesigning the Consultations page for CRUD on history, color-coded by type (Visite red, Contrôle green). The  page required a financial dashboard, payment list with filters, and unpaid management, simplifying payments to Espece and a binary Assuré status, with a default 65 TND. Recent enhancements integrated financial statistics widgets, customizable Excel export, and advanced payment history search/delete. The Dashboard needed Rappels et alertes for birthdays and call reminders, with direct patient/consultation access, replacing Patients en retard. A persistent problem was the payment amount not displaying correctly in the consultation modal. The user then explicitly requested a real-time instant messaging system to replace Activité Récente on the Dashboard, featuring read receipts (VU), sender-editable/deletable messages, quoted replies, daily history reset (8 AM), sound notifications, and visual role distinction (Dr/Sec).

<pending_tasks>
-   Investigate and resolve the persistent issue where the payment amount for Visite consultations is not reliably displaying in the consultation overview modal on the main Consultations page (), despite backend data correctness and frontend cache-busting attempts.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the full implementation and iterative refinement of a real-time instant messaging system. This system replaced the previous Activité Récente section on the Dashboard.

**Key functionalities implemented and confirmed working include:**
1.  **Real-time Messaging**: Messages appear instantly without page refresh, facilitated by WebSocket communication between the frontend () and backend (). Initial issues with non-real-time display were resolved by correcting WebSocket URLs ( for Kubernetes ingress) on both frontend and backend.
2.  **Message Management (CRUD)**: Users can send, edit, and delete messages in real-time. Delete functionality required significant iterative fixes, culminating in the implementation of an optimistic update on the client-side and a custom confirmation modal to ensure user clarity and interaction.
3.  **Read Receipts**: A VU (seen) indicator is now visibly displayed next to messages, and messages are automatically marked as read when viewed.
4.  **Role Distinction**: Sender names are abbreviated to Dr or Sec for clear visual differentiation between doctors and secretaries.
5.  **Duplication Prevention**: Logic was implemented to prevent messages from appearing in duplicate due to optimistic updates combined with WebSocket reception.
6.  **Sound Notifications**: An audible two-tone notification is played upon the arrival of new messages, with a manual test button integrated for user verification.
7.  **Reply Feature**: Users can reply to specific messages, quoting the original content.
8.  **Daily Message Cleanup**: A backend task is set up to clear message history daily at 8 AM.

All features of the messaging system have undergone extensive testing and user feedback iterations, addressing issues like real-time display, message duplication, persistent delete button non-functionality, visual design, and sound functionality.
