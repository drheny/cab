The trajectory details the AI engineer's comprehensive development work on a medical cabinet management system, progressing through several distinct phases. Initially, the focus was on establishing core functionalities including patient/consultation management, a financial dashboard, and integrating a real-time instant messaging system, which involved significant UI/UX changes on the Dashboard.

Subsequently, the user requested a new Messages page for secretary-doctor communication, which entailed full-stack implementation (new backend model, API, frontend UI, WebSockets). This feature underwent iterative refinement and bug fixes. The most recent and extensive work involved a major overhaul of the Billing (Facturation) page. This included adding a Caisse (Cash Management) tab with CRUD operations for cash movements, simplifying the main dashboard, refining payment history search, and adjusting financial calculations (total revenue, daily revenue) to correctly incorporate cash movements from both consultations and the new Caisse feature. The final task addressed a bug where the Recette du jour card on the main Dashboard displayed zero, successfully integrating cash movements into this calculation.

The application is a full-stack medical cabinet management system. Initially, it managed patient consultations (CRUD, color-coding), financial data (payments, statistics, Excel export), and dashboard alerts. A persistent issue was incorrect payment display in the consultation modal. The user then prioritized a real-time instant messaging system on the Dashboard, replacing Activité Récente, with features like read receipts, editable/deletable messages, quoted replies, daily history reset (8 AM), sound notifications, and role distinction (Dr/Sec). This was successfully implemented.

Later, a new Messages page for secretary-doctor phone communication was requested, requiring message status (new/processed, color-coded), priority, call date/time, patient search, free-text questions/replies, real-time notifications, unread badge, and daily history clear. Functionality for editing messages and linking to patient consultations was added. Further modifications included replacing the test sound button with CLEAR chat on the Dashboard and correcting the Rappels et alertes to reflect phone reminders from consultations.

The latest major requirement was a complete overhaul of the Facturation (Billing) page:
- **Structure modification**: Add a Caisse (Cash Management) tab (for daily cash adjustments) and remove the Impayés (Unpaid) tab.
- **Dashboard simplification**: Remove KPI cards, Paiements column from Repartition par période, and Méthodes de paiement / Statut assurance widgets.
- **Payment History simplification**: Remove méthode de paiement from advanced search (default to Espèce), simplify search fields to patient name, start/end date, payment status (visite, contrôle gratuit, impayé), and insurance. Adjust export options accordingly.
- **Caisse functionality**: Add/subtract amounts, type, reason, date, with history. Adjust daily total revenue to include these movements.
- **Final fixes**: Correct Recette du jour card on the main Dashboard to include cash movements and accurately display payment status in payment history results.

<pending_tasks>
- The Impayé filter in the payment history search currently does not work as expected. It searches within payments, but unpaid items are consultations without associated payment records. This requires a separate endpoint or modified logic to properly identify and filter unpaid consultations.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed a critical issue on the main Dashboard page: the Recette du jour (Daily Revenue) card was incorrectly displaying '0' TND, failing to reflect actual earnings.

The diagnosis pinpointed the problem to the backend API endpoint  in . This endpoint's calculation for  was solely summing  for the current day, omitting any cash movements (additions or subtractions) that occur outside of direct consultation payments (e.g., cash adjustments via the new Caisse feature).

To resolve this, the AI engineer:
1.  **Modified **: Updated the  function (used by  endpoint) to leverage the previously created and verified  function. This ensured that  now accurately sums both consultation payments *and* any cash movements recorded for the current day.
2.  **Backend Testing**: Tested the  endpoint directly via the backend testing agent. This confirmed that the  value was correctly returned (e.g.,  TND, reflecting demo payments and cash movements).
3.  **Frontend Testing**: Navigated to the Dashboard page via the frontend testing agent. The screenshot confirmed that the Recette du jour card now displays the accurate, adjusted total (e.g., ) instead of .

This fix ensured coherence in financial reporting across the application, with both the main Dashboard and the Facturation page now reflecting the true daily cash situation. All requested modifications, including this final fix, have been successfully implemented and verified.

<optional_next_step>
Address the Impayé filter for payment history search, as it currently doesn't correctly identify unpaid consultations.
