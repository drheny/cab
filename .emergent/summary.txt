<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully brought the medical cabinet management application from an MVP state to a robust system. Key initial developments included fixing calendar issues, building a WhatsApp communication hub, and implementing a comprehensive AI data enrichment backend using Google Gemini. Authentication was upgraded from a bypass to a full username/password system with user management features in . A major refactoring consolidated AI panels into . The last significant task before the work was passed on was enhancing Rapports Avanc√©s with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash for deeper contextual analysis and ML predictions.

Following the handover, the AI engineer addressed several new user requests: implementing bidirectional phone messaging between doctors and secretaries, allowing customization of displayed user names (full name and role) in the header and sidebar, and a series of UI/UX improvements. These UI/UX improvements involved removing a rappels t√©l√©phoniques button, refining the internal messaging design, making the WhatsApp button minimalist on the patients' list, enabling robust date-of-birth search with  format, and correctly restricting AI Room access for secretaries in the sidebar. The process involved iterative bug fixing, especially for the messaging design and search functionality, which required re-evaluation and targeted code adjustments to meet the user's aesthetic and functional expectations.

<product_requirements>
The application is a medical cabinet management system, facilitating patient management, consultations, financial transactions, and real-time messaging. Key features developed include fixing the Impay√© filter, a comprehensive Administration page for user and permission management, and UI/UX improvements such as multi-instance modals in . A core component is the AI-powered WhatsApp communication hub for automated notifications and AI-predicted suggestions.

Recent focus areas included enriching AI data for predictive analytics, leading to Full Automation Features and Enhanced Dashboard Features. This involved a hybrid AI integration with Google Gemini, centralizing AI functionalities into a dedicated AI Room, and upgrading the login system to full username/password authentication with user/access management. The Rapports Avanc√©s section in Statistiques was restored and enriched with Gemini AI, offering advanced ML predictions, top profitable patients analysis, and seasonal activity insights.

New requests addressed include:
1.  **Bidirectional Phone Messages:** Enable doctors to send messages to secretaries, mirroring the secretary's capability.
2.  **Customizable Display Names:** Personalize user names (e.g., Dr Heni Dridi, Secr√©taire M√©dicale) displayed in the sidebar and dashboard header, retrieving them from user administration profiles.
3.  **Dashboard UI:** Remove the Rappels t√©l√©phoniques button from Actions rapides and refine internal messaging UI to a modern, minimalist style.
4.  **Patients Page UI/Functionality:** Change the WhatsApp button to a minimalist icon (like other action icons) and enable real-time patient search by date of birth in  format.
5.  **Access Rights:** Ensure the AI Room tab in the sidebar is correctly hidden for secretaries when permissions are restricted.

All explicitly requested features (login, reports, user management, Gemini enrichment, bidirectional messaging, custom names, UI/UX improvements, search, permissions fixes) have been implemented and verified as fully functional by the AI engineer.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed a series of bug fixes and refinements based on direct user feedback. The primary focus was to address reported discrepancies and improve user experience.

Specifically, the following were addressed:
1.  **Internal Messaging Design:** The user reported that the message bubbles design was not changed to the desired minimalist style. The AI engineer re-iterated on  to replace the previous design with a more sober, minimalist look featuring black/grey bubbles and a simplified header.
2.  **WhatsApp Button on Patients Page:** The user noted that the WhatsApp button in the patients list still wasn't the minimalist icon desired. The AI engineer refined the implementation in  to ensure the WhatsApp button appeared as a small green WA icon, consistent with other action icons, referencing  for styling inspiration.
3.  **Patient Search by Date of Birth:** The user identified a critical issue where typing a date like 22/ would cause search results to disappear. The AI engineer debugged , specifically modifying the  logic to be less restrictive and allow progressive typing of dates (e.g., 22, 22/, 22/03, 22/03/2019) without clearing results, while still performing the search correctly once a valid date fragment is entered.

All these issues were confirmed as resolved through screenshots and detailed verification steps. The application now fully implements all requested UI/UX improvements, search functionality, and design refinements, with the messaging design, WhatsApp button, and date search working as intended.
