The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the medical cabinet application from a basic MVP to an AI-enhanced system. Initial work focused on fixing multi-instance modal issues in  and developing a robust WhatsApp communication hub with auto-confirmation and AI suggestions. A significant effort was dedicated to building a comprehensive AI data enrichment backend in  using new Pydantic models and various AI engines, integrated into the  frontend. Authentication was bypassed, and initial URL configuration issues were resolved.

Recent developments focused on implementing Full Automation Features in the backend and Enhanced Dashboard Features on the frontend. A crucial pivot involved integrating Google Gemini, which necessitated installing , configuring the API key in , and adding new AI-enhanced endpoints in . Frontend components (, ) were updated to utilize these Gemini-powered insights. A critical runtime error related to  in , caused by data structure changes, was meticulously debugged and fixed across multiple sections using a helper function.

Finally, the user requested consolidating all AI panels from  into a restructured . This involved a complete refactoring of  and the removal of these panels from . While the structural migration was successful and the dashboard was cleaned, an  screenshot indicates an unresolved display issue within the Automatisation tab of the new , suggesting further frontend work is required there. The process also faced intermittent system command execution issues.

<product_requirements>
The application is a medical cabinet management system, designed to manage patients, consultations, and finances, with real-time messaging. Core initial requirements included fixing the Impay√© filter, developing a comprehensive Administration page for user management and reporting, and general UI/UX improvements. A critical fix involved enabling multiple independent consultation modal instances in .

The major recent feature was an AI-powered waiting room, which evolved into a secretary-controlled WhatsApp communication hub. This hub provides automatic appointment confirmations, real-time waiting room updates (rank, estimated time), and flexible delayed appointment notifications via WhatsApp links, all enhanced by AI predictions and requiring secretary confirmation.

Current work focused on enriching AI data for temporal, proactive, and behavioral predictions, which saw significant backend implementation and dashboard integration. This included Full Automation Features (self-optimizing schedules, advanced predictive automation, workflow optimization) and Enhanced Dashboard Features (improved visualizations, widget system). The latest directive involved a hybrid AI integration using Google Gemini (with an API key provided) and centralizing all AI-related functionalities by moving panels from the main dashboard into a dedicated, restructured AI Room page.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on fulfilling the user's explicit request to consolidate all AI-related panels from the main dashboard into a dedicated AI Room page, following the successful integration of Google Gemini into the backend.

The key actions taken were:
1.  **Restructuring **: The existing  was completely rewritten to serve as the new central hub for all AI functionalities, preparing it to house the relocated AI panels.
2.  **Dashboard Cleanup**: The , , and  components, along with their associated import statements, state management (e.g., ), and rendering logic ( function and its JSX rendering sections), were systematically removed from . This successfully cleaned up the dashboard to no longer display these AI-specific features.

The product's current state is that the AI panels have been physically moved and the  has been cleaned as requested, confirmed by screenshots showing an uncluttered dashboard. However, during testing of the newly restructured  page, a frontend display error () was observed when attempting to access the Automatisation tab. This indicates that while the panels have been moved, their complete functional integration and display within the new  structure, specifically for the automation features, is not yet fully operational. The backend AI endpoints, including the Gemini enhancements, are confirmed to be working correctly.
