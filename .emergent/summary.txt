The AI engineer's trajectory details the development and refinement of a medical cabinet management system. It began by addressing the Impayé filter bug on the billing page, fixing the backend query for unpaid consultations. A major feature, the Administration page, was then built, including statistics, data management, and user controls. Subsequent tasks focused on UI/UX improvements: preventing duplicate real-time messaging notifications on the Dashboard, adding a quick Add Appointment button to the Patients list with patient pre-selection, and implementing individual/mass message deletion on the Messages page. The final completed tasks involved adding a View Consultations button to the patient preview modal in , implementing robust payment security rules in the Calendar page to restrict secretary access to finished payments, and finally, applying the previously developed stylus/iPad layout optimizations to the consultation modal embedded within . The engineer consistently performed code modifications, followed by testing, and actively troubleshooted issues identified by the user, ultimately ensuring each feature met the specified requirements.

<product_requirements>
The application is a full-stack medical cabinet management system for patient/consultation, financial, and dashboard management. It features a real-time instant messaging system and a separate Messages page for secretary-doctor communication. The Facturation (Billing) page includes a Caisse tab and refined payment history.

Recent explicit requests from the user, addressed in this trajectory, include:
1.  **Impayé Filter Fix**: Correctly displaying unpaid consultations in payment history.
2.  **Administration Page**: A new doctor-only page with stats, data reset/export, user management, and quick actions.
3.  **Dashboard Messaging Notifications**: Fixing duplicate toast messages.
4.  **Patients List - Add Appointment Button**: Adding a button to quickly open an appointment modal with the patient pre-selected.
5.  **Messages Page - Delete Buttons**: Adding individual and Clear all message deletion buttons.
6.  **Consultation Modal Layout & Stylus Optimization**: Making Observation clinique, Traitement, and Bilans fields full-width and stylus-optimized for iPad.
7.  **Patients List - View Consultations Button**: Adding a button in the patient preview modal to redirect to the Consultation page with the patient pre-selected.
8.  **Calendar Page - Payment Security**: Restricting secretary access to modify payment status for consultations that are terminated and paid (or gratuit); only doctors can modify. Secretary can still modify if non payé.
9.  **Calendar Page - Consultation Modal Layout Fix**: Applying stylus/iPad layout optimizations to the consultation modal directly embedded in the Calendar page, matching .

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines main application structure and routing.
    -   **Changes**: Routing likely updated for new pages like  (implicit).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages patient records, displays patient list, and provides quick actions.
    -   **Changes**: Added a Calendar icon button to each patient row to trigger appointment creation with patient pre-selection, integrating . Also, a Voir Consultations button was added to the patient preview modal to navigate to  with the patient pre-selected, mimicking .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Modal for creating new appointments.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to support patient pre-selection via  hook and ensure  is correctly passed to .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer completed the task of applying the stylus/iPad layout optimizations to the consultation modal *within the Calendar page*.

The work involved:
1.  **Diagnosis**: Identifying that the Calendar page's consultation modal was an *embedded* component within  itself, not an instance of the separate  component which had been previously optimized.
2.  **Modifying **:
    *   The , , and  fields within the Calendar's internal consultation modal (specifically lines 1171-1211) were restructured. They were changed from a two-column grid to full-width and stacked vertically, providing more space.
    *   The  CSS class was explicitly applied to these fields.
    *   Placeholders were updated to include Optimisé pour Apple Pencil.
3.  **Verification of CSS**: Confirmed that the necessary  class definitions and associated media queries (for iPad/stylus specific optimizations) were already present in .
4.  **Testing**: Automated frontend testing was used (). The tests confirmed that the layout modifications and stylus optimizations were correctly applied to the Calendar's consultation modal, matching the intended design and functionality of the standalone  component. This included checking the correct application of CSS classes, layout changes, and placeholder texts.

This ensures a consistent and optimized handwriting experience for medical professionals using iPads/styluses, regardless of whether they access the consultation modal from the dedicated Consultation page or directly from the Calendar workflow.
