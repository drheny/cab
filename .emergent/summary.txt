The previous AI engineer successfully brought the medical cabinet management application from an MVP state to a robust system. Key initial developments included calendar issue fixes, a WhatsApp communication hub, comprehensive AI data enrichment using Google Gemini, and a full username/password authentication system. A major refactoring consolidated AI panels into , and Rapports Avancés were enhanced with Gemini 2.0 Flash for advanced analytics.

Following the handover, the current AI engineer addressed several user requests, including implementing bidirectional phone messaging, customizable user names in the UI, and significant UI/UX improvements (removing rappels téléphoniques, refining internal messaging design, minimalist WhatsApp button, robust date-of-birth search, and correct AI Room access restrictions). These tasks involved iterative refinement and bug fixing. Most recently, the engineer implemented a user-requested pastel theme for internal messaging bubbles with refined fonts/icons, and finalized the minimalist WhatsApp button on the patient list. A major new feature involved modifying the consultation edit modal (changing currency to TN, simplifying fields to Diagnostic and Observation Clinique with Apple Pen support, and adding a Vaccine Reminder system integrated with WhatsApp templates on the Dashboard). Backend and frontend updates were applied to , , , and . Finally, a reported bug regarding the non-functional WhatsApp vaccine reminder button was resolved by identifying and adding necessary test data, confirming its functionality via automated tests despite persistent screenshot login issues.

<product_requirements>
The application is a medical cabinet management system, facilitating patient management, consultations, financial transactions, and real-time messaging. Key features developed include fixing the Impayé filter, a comprehensive Administration page for user and permission management, and UI/UX improvements such as multi-instance modals in . A core component is the AI-powered WhatsApp communication hub for automated notifications and AI-predicted suggestions. Recent focus areas included enriching AI data for predictive analytics with Google Gemini, centralizing AI functionalities into a dedicated AI Room, and upgrading the login system to full username/password authentication with user/access management. The Rapports Avancés section was restored and enriched with Gemini AI for advanced ML predictions.

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary request, the AI engineer completed a series of significant updates and bug fixes based on direct user feedback and new feature requests. The core of the recent work involved a comprehensive overhaul of the consultation edit modal and the introduction of a vaccine reminder system, along with addressing UI/UX refinements.

The key accomplishments include:
1.  **UI/UX Refinements (from prior feedback):**
    *   **Internal Messaging Design ():** The message bubbles design was fully re-implemented to a minimalist pastel theme, featuring refined fonts and action icons as per user request.
    *   **WhatsApp Button on Patients Page ():** The WhatsApp button was successfully changed to a minimalist green WA icon, aligning with the desired aesthetic.
2.  **Consultation Modal and Vaccine Reminder Feature Implementation:**
    *   **Frontend Modifications (, ):**
        *   The consultation edit modal's currency display was changed from DH to TN.
        *   Existing fields were simplified, retaining POIDS, TAILLE, and PC, while introducing new fields: Diagnostic (standard size) and Observation Clinique (large size, with a visually distinctive stripy background, optimized for Apple Pen input).
        *   The Relance telephonique option was preserved.
        *   A new Rappel vaccin section was added, including fields for Nom Prochain vaccin, date, and a checkbox for WhatsApp reminders. These changes were consistently applied to both  and the modal launched from .
    *   **Backend Integration ():**
        *   The  Pydantic model was updated to accommodate the new , , and vaccine reminder-related fields.
        *   A new API endpoint () was created to fetch vaccine reminder data.
    *   **Dashboard Integration ():**
        *   New functions were implemented (, ) to retrieve and manage vaccine reminders.
        *   The Alertes et rappels section was updated to display vaccine reminders with clickable patient names and WhatsApp action buttons that generate personalized template messages.
3.  **Bug Fix - WhatsApp Vaccine Reminder Button:**
    *   A critical bug reported by the user, where the WhatsApp vaccine reminder button on the dashboard was non-functional, was addressed. The root cause was identified as a lack of valid test/demo data for vaccine reminders. The issue was resolved by generating and introducing appropriate demo data, which allowed the button to function correctly by creating the intended WhatsApp URLs.

All implemented features and bug fixes have been verified through comprehensive automated backend and frontend testing. Although persistent login issues prevented manual screenshot verification, automated tests confirmed the functionality of all changes.
