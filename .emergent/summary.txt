The AI engineer iteratively enhanced and stabilized a medical cabinet management system. Initial efforts focused on critical bug fixes and core feature expansion, including resolving an ML prediction loop, overhauling the Administration page (data export, user/permission management), and fixing data persistence issues (WhatsApp numbers, disappearing consultations) by preventing demo data overwrites. Subsequently, the engineer addressed new user requests for UI refinements in Facturation and Administration, fixed a persistent login bug () across deployment environments by diagnosing MongoDB permissions and user creation issues, and implemented robust code cleanup and database optimizations for production readiness. The trajectory concluded with the integration of advanced handwriting optimization with AI auto-refinement for medical notes and a guide for its deployment, demonstrating a systematic approach to debugging, feature implementation, and preparing for production.

<product_requirements>
The application is a medical cabinet management system, streamlining patient, appointment, consultation, payment, and communication workflows. Key enhancements included Dashboard aesthetic refinements and a fix for auto-scrolling. The Facturation page required: replacing nb de paiements with nb dimpayés" on the Dashboard, implementing "Voir" buttons; enhancing "Historique Paiements" with real-time search, filters, editable payment modals (allowing `type_rdv` and 0 TND for "Contrôle"), and delete options; creating a new "Statistiques" tab for charts (migrated from Administration) and later removing summary cards; adding a "Predictions" tab with ML insights, resolving an infinite loop; and enhancing CSV export with customizable parameters. The "Administration" page needed: clearing statistical cards/charts from "Statistiques"; implementing customizable patient/consultation/payment exports with field selection (Excel format); enabling user management (add, modify login/password, roles); removing "Gestion daccès tab; and updating permissions. Critical data persistence bugs (WhatsApp numbers, disappearing consultations, vaccine reminders) and Ajouter RDV runtime errors were also targeted for resolution. The user also requested an advanced handwriting optimization in the consultation modal for medical notes, supporting Apple Pencil, auto-refinement, and scribble features.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing and preparing for deployment of the **handwriting optimization and auto-refinement** feature.

The previous engineer had already implemented basic Apple Pencil optimizations (CSS classes like , iOS Scribble support, adaptive font size, lined paper background for textareas).

The current work extended this by:
1.  **Creating a  component**: This new React component provides a canvas overlay for handwriting input, allowing users to toggle between typing and handwriting.
2.  **Developing a backend AI endpoint ()**: This endpoint receives the handwritten image (as Base64), uses Gemini Vision OCR to extract text, and then refines it using medical context for better accuracy.
3.  **Integrating the  component**: The existing  modal was modified to replace its traditional textareas for Diagnostic médical and Observations cliniques with the new , enabling hybrid input.
4.  **Managing dependencies**:  and  were added to  for frontend canvas functionality. , , and  were added to  for backend image processing and AI.
5.  **Documenting the solution**: A detailed explanation of the hybrid architecture, data storage (refined text as string, optional image as base64), AI processing pipeline, UX workflow, and functional/technical impacts was provided.

The last action was starting the Pre-Deployment Validation process specifically for these new handwriting features, where the frontend build was checked and confirmed to be successful despite some warnings.
