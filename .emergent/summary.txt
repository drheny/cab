<analysis>
The AI engineer's work trajectory chronicles the comprehensive development of a medical cabinet management application. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the foundational React frontend and FastAPI backend by resolving critical dependency issues and cleaning up code. A major phase involved completely redesigning the Consultations component, first to integrate it as an overlay in the Calendar page with a stopwatch and then to transform it into a dedicated patient-centric consultation history page with full CRUD capabilities. Subsequent efforts were heavily concentrated on debugging data persistence and display issues, particularly the accurate presentation of consultation types and associated payment amounts in the consultation overview modal. This involved harmonizing data payloads between frontend components, updating the backend data model, and meticulously troubleshooting asynchronous data loading and data consistency in the database. The trajectory concludes with an ongoing effort to ensure the correct display of payment amounts after manual database intervention.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to develop a full-stack medical cabinet management application. Initial requirements focused on stabilizing the existing React frontend and FastAPI backend by fixing 500 errors and frontend compilation warnings. A key feature involved redesigning the Consultations component to manage patient consultation data, including fields like Weight, Height, Medical Observation, Treatment, etc., integrating an automatic stopwatch, and implementing a patient workflow (waiting, in-consultation, completed). Patients in CONSULTATION en cours should trigger a modal overlay for data entry with a minimizable stopwatch. Subsequent requirements expanded to restructuring the main Consultations page as a patient-centric hub, featuring a search field, patient banner, detailed patient information (age, address, parents' info, WhatsApp link, medical history), a central listing of consultation history (with CRUD operations, color-coding for Visite and Contrôle), and an add consultation button opening the same overlay modal used in the Calendar page. Recent work has focused on ensuring accurate display of consultation types and associated payment amounts.

<pending_tasks>
- Ensure the  (payment amount) for Visite consultations reliably displays in the consultation overview modal, addressing any lingering data consistency or asynchronous loading issues.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was actively engaged in troubleshooting and fixing the persistent issue where the payment amount for Visite type consultations was not displaying in the consultation overview modal on the main Consultations page.

The root cause was identified as a combination of factors:
1.  **Data Inconsistency:** Existing consultation records lacked the  field, causing issues with identifying Visite consultations.
2.  **Payment Data Linkage:** Test payment data sometimes did not correctly link to consultation s.
3.  **Asynchronous Timing:** The consultation view modal was opening before the  API call could complete and update the state, leading to a blank display.

To address these, the following actions have been taken:
-   The backend  model was updated to include .
-   Frontend  was modified to ensure  is included when saving consultations and to correctly display  and  in the view modal.
-   The  function in  was improved to handle asynchronous loading more robustly, including  state and an  for the API call.
-   Test payment data was manually created/updated in the backend to ensure it correctly linked with s.
-   A manual database update was performed (via a temporary backend debug endpoint) to explicitly set  for a specific test consultation ( with ) to isolate and test the display issue.

The current state is that the backend has been updated, the frontend logic for display and async handling is in place, and a specific test consultation has been manually prepared in the database. The very last action in the trajectory was the AI engineer initiating a frontend test to verify if the payment amount now displays correctly after this manual data fix.
