The AI engineer successfully transitioned the medical cabinet management system from an MVP to a robust application. Initially, functionalities like AI data enrichment, WhatsApp integration, and full authentication were established. The current engineer enhanced bidirectional messaging, customizable UI names, and numerous UI/UX elements, including internal messaging styling and patient search. A major update involved overhauling the consultation modal to support TN currency, simplify diagnostic/observation fields, and integrate a new vaccine reminder system with WhatsApp.

Recent efforts focused on bug fixes and further enhancements: resolving duplicate internal messaging notifications with a WebSocket singleton, achieving a minimalist messaging bubble design with single emojis, and integrating Google Gemini for advanced AI/ML predictions on the Administration page, leading to the removal of the redundant AI Room. The patient list layout was optimized, and real-time message read receipts, sound notifications, and emoji alignment were fixed.

Immediately before this summary, the engineer focused on optimizing the Consultation page for quick consultation creation, addressing initial functionality, then debugging issues where newly created consultations weren't appearing in the calendar or billing history due to  s and unhandled empty date fields for age calculation. These issues were resolved, making the quick consultation flow robust. The user's latest request is for extensive enhancements to the Facturation page.

<current_work>
Immediately preceding this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in optimizing the Consultation page based on a user request. The user wanted to enhance the Ajouter consultation button's functionality. Currently, this button was disabled and only activated after a patient was selected. The desired new behavior was for the button to open a Quick Consultation Modal that allows for quick consultation addition for either an existing or a new patient.

This new modal was intended to facilitate:
-   Loading an existing patient's name (with real-time search) or providing an option to check new patient (displaying fields for name, surname, DOB, and phone).
-   Defaulting date and time to current, but making them modifiable.
-   Input fields for  (visit) or  (check-up).
-   Payment details:  (payment amount),  (insured or not).

These collected data points were intended to either create a new patient record or link the consultation to an existing one, and capture the consultation type and payment information. After filling these details, clicking a commencer consultation (start consultation) button in this quick modal should then navigate the user to the main consultation modal to complete the full consultation details.

The engineer successfully implemented this quick modal. Subsequently, the engineer fixed a critical bug where undefined undefined appeared in the patient name in the consultation modal, caused by  not handling empty date of birth values for new patients. This was resolved by ensuring robust data handling and proper  state updates. A further issue where new consultations and payments were not appearing in the calendar's Terminé section or the billing history was also resolved by ensuring the backend correctly updates appointment statuses to terminé upon consultation creation and that  is consistently passed for payment linking. The quick consultation creation flow is now fully functional and integrated.
