The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's work on a medical cabinet management system. Initially, the focus shifted from an unresolved payment display issue in the consultation modal to a complete real-time instant messaging system on the Dashboard, which was successfully built and refined. Subsequently, the user requested a new Messages page for secretary-doctor communication, which the AI engineer implemented from scratch, including backend models, API endpoints, frontend UI, and real-time notifications. This new feature underwent iterative bug fixes, notably for message editing and patient consultation linking, which required extensive React hook debugging and demo data regeneration. Finally, the engineer addressed user requests to replace the test sound button with a CLEAR chat button on the Dashboard, resolving persistent issues with its functionality, and corrected the Rappels et alertes dashboard indicator to accurately reflect phone reminders from consultations.

The application is a full-stack medical cabinet management system. Core functionalities included patient consultation management (CRUD, color-coding), financial dashboard with payment management (Espece, Assur√©, default 65 TND), financial statistics, and customizable Excel export. The Dashboard initially featured Rappels et alertes for birthdays/calls. A persistent issue involved the payment amount not displaying correctly in the consultation modal.

The user then pivoted, requesting a real-time instant messaging system to replace Activit√© R√©cente on the Dashboard, featuring read receipts (VU), sender-editable/deletable messages, quoted replies, daily history reset (8 AM), sound notifications, and visual role distinction (Dr/Sec). This was successfully implemented.

Later, a new Messages page was requested for secretary-doctor communication regarding patient calls. This page required message status (new/processed, color-coded), priority (urgent/normal), call date/time, patient search, free-text questions (secretary), message list with filters, access to patient file/history (doctor), free-text replies (doctor), real-time notifications with unread message badge, and daily history clear at 8 AM. Further refinements included editing existing messages on the Messages page, ensuring the Voir consultation button correctly redirects and loads patient information and consultation history on the  page, replacing the test sound button with a CLEAR chat button on the Dashboard messaging system, and fixing the Rappels et alertes indicator to display phone reminders from consultations.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no explicitly pending tasks after the last successful fix and confirmation of the backend changes. The last action was a backend test, and the next step is to ask the user to test the frontend.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on resolving a reported issue where the Rappels et alertes (Reminders and Alerts) indicator on the Dashboard page was not correctly retrieving phone reminders that were created within patient consultations.

The diagnosis revealed that the backend API endpoint  in  was incorrectly querying  for a  field instead of looking at  for their  (reminder date).

To fix this, the AI engineer:
1.  **Modified **: Updated the  endpoint to correctly query the  collection, filtering for  values that match the current day.
2.  **Updated Demo Data**: Added new demo consultation data within  to include  entries for  and  for the current day, ensuring there was data to test the fix.
3.  **Restarted Backend and Re-initialized Demo Data**: Applied the changes and refreshed the database with the new demo data to reflect the changes.
4.  **Tested Backend**: Used the backend testing agent to verify that the  endpoint now correctly returns the reminders from consultations, which was confirmed as successful.

This completed the backend portion of the fix.

<optional_next_step>
Ask the user if they wish to proceed with frontend testing for the phone reminders display on the Dashboard.
