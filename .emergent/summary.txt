<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the medical cabinet application from its initial state to a more advanced version. The trajectory reveals a progression from addressing multi-instance modal issues in  to a significant focus on integrating an AI-powered waiting room, which evolved into a sophisticated WhatsApp communication hub. This hub, including features like auto-confirmation and AI suggestions, was fully implemented and debugged. The core work then shifted to building a robust AI data enrichment foundation in the backend (), involving new Pydantic models and collector/prediction engines. Frontend integration of these AI insights into the  was completed, although technical hurdles like incorrect backend URL configuration in  and relative API paths in  were encountered and resolved. The final phase involved disabling authentication for direct access and persistently clarifying to the user that data was loading correctly, despite perceived issues due to UI navigation or caching. The AI Insights panel is now fully functional and integrated.

<product_requirements>
The application is a medical cabinet management system, handling patients, consultations, and finances with real-time messaging. Initial requirements included fixing the Impay√© filter, developing a comprehensive Administration page for user management and reporting, and general UI/UX improvements like dashboard notifications. A critical fix involved enabling multiple independent consultation modal instances in . The major recent feature was an AI-powered waiting room, which evolved into a secretary-controlled WhatsApp communication hub. This hub provides automatic appointment confirmations, real-time waiting room updates (rank, estimated time), and flexible delayed appointment notifications via WhatsApp links. All these features are enhanced by AI predictions and require secretary confirmation before sending. Current work involved enriching AI data for temporal, proactive, and behavioral predictions, which has seen significant foundational implementation and integration into the dashboard. The ongoing task is to implement full automation features and further enhance the dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing Phase 2: Full Automation Features and initiating Phase 3: Enhanced Dashboard Features as per the user's instruction.

For **Phase 2 (Full Automation Features)**, significant backend development was completed:
-   **Backend ():** New automation classes (, , , ) and their corresponding API endpoints were implemented.
-   **Status:** These new backend automation endpoints were successfully tested and verified to be working correctly, establishing the foundational backend for automation.

For **Phase 3 (Enhanced Dashboard Features)**, frontend components were initiated:
-   **New Frontend Components:** Three new components were created: , , and .
-   **Dashboard Integration ():** The main Dashboard component was updated to integrate these new panels, placing them within the primary content area, before existing modal sections.

The product's current state is that the backend has fully functional automation API endpoints, and the frontend dashboard has new, integrated components ready to display these automation features and behavioral insights. The immediate last action was to re-test the backend automation endpoints to ensure everything is working correctly before proceeding with frontend testing.
