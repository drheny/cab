<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory details the evolution of a medical cabinet management application. Initially, it focused on stabilizing the React frontend and FastAPI backend by resolving dependency issues and refactoring. A major shift involved redesigning the Consultations component from a calendar overlay to a dedicated patient-centric history page with full CRUD capabilities. Subsequent efforts concentrated on debugging payment amount display in the consultation overview modal, addressing data inconsistency, asynchronous loading, and cache-busting. Despite multiple attempts, including manual data fixes and cache mechanisms, the payment amount display in the consultation modal remained problematic. The user then requested a comprehensive analysis of the payment component, leading to a refactored backend data model, creation of a dedicated  component, and a complete reconstruction of the  page based on a new vision. The most recent work involved simplifying the payment module (single payment method, simplified assurance, default amount) and fixing view and edit functionalities on the  page, while the core issue of payment display in the consultation modal persisted, being explicitly re-identified as a critical error at the end of the trajectory.

<product_requirements>
The application aims to be a full-stack medical cabinet management system. Initial requirements included stabilizing existing React and FastAPI components by resolving 500 errors and frontend warnings. A core feature was to manage patient consultations, capturing details like weight, height, medical observations, and treatment, integrated with a stopwatch. A patient workflow (waiting, in-consultation, completed) was needed, where CONSULTATION en cours triggered a modal overlay for data entry with a minimizable stopwatch.

Later, the Consultations page was redesigned as a patient-centric hub. This included a patient search, banner, detailed patient information (age, address, parents' info, WhatsApp link, medical history), and a central listing of consultation history with full CRUD operations. Consultations were to be color-coded (Visite in red, Contrôle in green). An add consultation button should open the same overlay modal used in the Calendar page.

Recent focus has been on ensuring accurate display of consultation types and associated payment amounts. This evolved into a request to analyze the entire payment component, integrating it across Calendar, Consultation modal, and a new Billing/Facturation page. The Billing page was to be rebuilt with a financial dashboard, a comprehensive payment list, and unpaid management. Lastly, the payment module itself needed simplification: only Espece payment, binary Assuré status (no reimbursement rate), and a default payment amount of 65 TND. Errors in the Billing page's view and edit buttons for payment history also needed fixing, alongside the persistent issue of payment amount not displaying in the consultation modal.

<pending_tasks>
- Investigate and resolve the persistent issue where the payment amount for Visite consultations is not reliably displaying in the consultation overview modal on the main Consultations page, despite backend data correctness and frontend cache-busting attempts.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on simplifying the payment module and fixing reported bugs on the  (Facturation) page.

**Completed Simplifications and Fixes:**
1.  **Payment Module Simplification**:
    *   **Frontend ()**: The payment method selection was streamlined to allow only Espece (cash). The Assuré (insured) field was simplified to a simple boolean checkbox, removing the need for a reimbursement rate.
    *   **Backend ()**: The backend logic for payment creation and updates was adjusted to reflect these simplifications, specifically handling only Espece as a payment type and removing  from the  model. A default  of 65 TND was set for new payments.
2.  **Billing Page () Fixes**:
    *   **Voir (View) Button**: The runtime error encountered when clicking this button was resolved by removing references to the now-eliminated  field. The display of the Assuré status in the payment view modal was corrected.
    *   **Edit Button**: The Edit button for payment history entries was made functional. An  handler was added, and a state variable () along with an  function were introduced to manage the data passed to an editing modal. A basic editing modal was also implemented.
    *   **Currency Display**: The currency formatting was updated to TND across the  page.

**Current Unresolved Issue**:
Despite extensive efforts in previous rounds, the core problem of the **payment amount not consistently displaying in the consultation overview modal** on the  page for Visite type consultations *persists*. The last frontend test summary (Chat Message 298) explicitly states: CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - Payment Amount Display. This indicates that while backend data for payments and consultation types is correct, and various frontend refresh/cache-busting attempts were made, the UI still fails to correctly retrieve and display the  for Visite consultations.

The product is now in a state where the payment input flow from Calendar is simplified, and the Billing page's viewing and editing functionalities for payment history are improved, but a critical display bug on the Consultation page remains.
