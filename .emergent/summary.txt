The AI engineer's work trajectory details the development of a medical cabinet management application. Initially, the focus was on stabilizing the existing React frontend and FastAPI backend. A critical bug related to FastAPI/Uvicorn dependency versions causing 500 errors was identified and resolved by upgrading backend packages. Following this, minor frontend compilation warnings were addressed. A significant feature rebuild involved completely redesigning the Consultations component with new fields, a stopwatch, and a comprehensive workflow for patient status transitions. The immediate ongoing task, requested by the user, is to refactor the Consultation modal to open as an overlay directly within the Calendar page, preventing unnecessary redirects and ensuring a seamless user experience. The AI engineer is actively integrating this modal into the  component.

The primary objective is to develop a full-stack medical cabinet management application.
**Initial Problem:** Test backend and frontend, and fix errors to ensure the application is functional. This involved ensuring backend APIs for dashboard, patients, and appointments were working, and the React frontend was loading and interacting correctly with the backend.

**Feature Development & Fixes:**
1.  **Backend Stability:** Resolve server-side errors, specifically focusing on API endpoints (e.g., , ) returning 500 Internal Server Errors.
2.  **Frontend Stability:** Address frontend compilation warnings and ensure the application loads and displays data without runtime errors.
3.  **Patient Record Overview Modification:** Remove the historique des consultations (consultation history) section from the patient record overview modal in the frontend.
4.  **Consultations Component Redesign (Major Feature):**
    *   Rebuild the Consultations component entirely from scratch.
    *   **Fields:** Include fields for Poids (Weight), Taille (Height), PC (numerical, integer), Observation médicale (text), Traitement (text), Bilans (text), Relance téléphonique (yes/no + date), and Durée de consultation (retrieved from an integrated stopwatch).
    *   **Workflow:**
        *   Patients in the waiting room can be moved to CONSULTATION en cours via an ENTRER button.
        *   Patients in CONSULTATION en cours display a Consultation button.
        *   Clicking this Consultation button should open a consultation modal as an *overlay* for data entry by doctors/secretaries.
        *   The modal must include an automatically starting stopwatch that pauses/stops upon consultation save.
        *   The modal should be minimizable/restorable, preserving entered data.
        *   Upon saving, the patient moves to the Terminé (completed) section.
5.  **Consultation Modal Interaction Correction (Current Task):**
    *   Modify the behavior of the Consultation button. Instead of redirecting to a separate consultations page, the consultation modal must open directly as an overlay on the *same page* (Calendar page), without navigating away.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on refactoring the  component to change the behavior of the Consultation button. The user explicitly requested that clicking this button should no longer redirect to a separate page but instead open the consultation modal as an overlay directly within the  view.

To achieve this, the following steps have been taken or are in progress within :
1.  **State Management:** New  hooks have been added to control the modal's visibility (), store the details of the currently selected appointment for consultation (), and manage the integrated stopwatch's state (, ).
2.  **Stopwatch Integration:** A  hook has been introduced to manage the logic for the consultation stopwatch, ensuring it increments the  when a consultation is active and not paused.
3.  **Modified :** The existing  function has been updated. Previously, it used  to redirect to a different page. Now, it sets  to  and populates  with the relevant patient data, initiating the display of the overlay modal.
4.  **Modal Management Functions:** The AI engineer is in the process of defining and adding helper functions (, , , ) which will manage the lifecycle of the new consultation modal within the  component, including saving data, closing the modal, and handling the stopwatch's play/pause functionality.
5.  **JSX Integration:** The final step, which was ongoing when the trajectory ended, is to embed the JSX (the visual structure) for the consultation modal directly into the  component, making it an integral part of the calendar page's rendering.

<optional_next_step>
Complete the integration of the consultation modal's JSX into  and connect it to the relevant state and event handlers.
